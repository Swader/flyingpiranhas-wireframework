###Flyingpiranhas Wireframework v0.1
####Please note that this is a first experimental build. Use at your own risk. The project is in its infancy, and even though we have built several production sites with it, we do not recommend you use it because we haven't thoroughly tested.

####Introduction
This is a skeleton application called the Flyingpiranhas Wireframework or WFW. When you download and unzip it, run composer install inside the folder to fetch the latest versions of required libraries and start working.

The WFW comes with HTML5 Boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap both built into its layouts.

####Requirements
- Php 5.4+
- See individual packages in composer.json and find them on packagist.org

####Installation
- Unzip
- Run "composer install"
- Go to application/config and change the database params to match yours
- Point vhost to public folder and make sure mod_rewrite is on
- Give PHP write permissions to the following folders: public/assets/minify, application/cache, application/logs, data/uploads
- Develop!

####Git
- Optionally, remove the hidden .git folder if you don't intend to use this to contribute to the original library. Keep the original .gitignore (it's quite robust) and init your own repo to be able to commit and push independently to wherever you want.

####License
See LICENSE.md

####Contributing
If you build some sexy open source demos with this, we'd love to hear about it! Also, if you benchmark it against other frameworks in different scenarios, we'd love to know the outcome, no matter which framework wins. We're committed to continuously optimise and improve these libraries!
